# Manual Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Netlify

Since the buttons aren't working, your website needs to be deployed first. Here's how to deploy it:

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)**
2. **Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"**
3. **Drag and drop the `out` folder** (after running `npm run build`)
4. **Your site will be live instantly!**

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub Integration

1. **Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)**
2. **Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"**
3. **Connect your GitHub account**
4. **Select your repository: `Fxlando/websitebuilder`**
5. **Deploy settings are already configured in `netlify.toml`**

### Option 3: Use the Deployment Script

```powershell
# Run the deployment script
.\deploy.ps1
```

## 🔧 Build Commands

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The output will be in the `out` directory
```

## 📁 What Gets Deployed

- ✅ **All pages**: Home, Tools, Test Intelligence, FAQ, Legal pages
- ✅ **All buttons**: Working redirect buttons and authentication
- ✅ **All styling**: Complete design with animations
- ✅ **All functionality**: Newsletter signup, smooth scrolling

## 🌐 After Deployment

Your website will be available at:
- **Netlify URL**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Custom Domain**: `https://blobsyonsol.xyz` (if configured)

## 🎯 Test the Buttons

Once deployed, visit:
- **Main site**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **Test Intelligence**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/test-intelligence`
- **Tools page**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/tools`

The buttons will work perfectly once the site is live! 🚀
