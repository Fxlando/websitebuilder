# Deployment Guide for Blob Token Landing Page

## ✅ Project Status

Your project is **fully configured and ready for deployment**! All issues have been fixed:

1. ✅ **Build Process**: Successfully builds with `npm run build`
2. ✅ **Static Export**: Configured for static hosting
3. ✅ **Netlify Config**: Fixed to use correct output directory (`out`)
4. ✅ **Metadata**: Added metadataBase to fix warnings
5. ✅ **Git Repository**: Initialized with initial commit
6. ✅ **Development Server**: Running on `npm run dev`

## 🚀 GitHub Setup

Since no GitHub remote is configured yet, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository (don't initialize with README)
3. Copy the repository URL

### 2. Connect Your Local Repository
```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## 🌐 Netlify Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy via Netlify CLI
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Option 2: Deploy via GitHub Integration
1. Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your repository
5. Deploy settings are already configured in `netlify.toml`

## 📝 Configuration Files

### netlify.toml (Already Configured)
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `out`
- Next.js plugin configured
- Remote images configured

### next.config.ts (Already Configured)
- Static export enabled
- Output directory: `out`
- Trailing slashes enabled
- Images unoptimized for static export

## 🔧 Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server

# Production
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server (local)

# Code Quality
npm run lint         # Run ESLint and TypeScript checks
npm run format       # Format code with Biome
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
2. Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
3. Verify `out` directory is created after build
4. Ensure no server-side features are used (static export only)

### Common Issues:
- **Build fails**: Run `npm install` then `npm run build` locally
- **404 errors**: Ensure `trailingSlash: true` in next.config.ts
- **Missing images**: Check image domains in next.config.ts

## 📊 Performance Tips

1. Images are unoptimized for static export
2. Consider using WebP format for better performance
3. Implement lazy loading for below-fold content
4. Use Netlify's built-in optimizations

Your site is ready to go live! 🎉
